## Goals
1. Start with a **semantic search** backend (ingest → embed → index → retrieve).
2. Evolve to full **RAG** (retrieval + LLM generation) with evaluation (LLM-based + human preference).
3. Provide reproducible experiments: two datasets supplied — a small **development dataset (100 entries)** and a larger **benchmark dataset (2000 entries)**.
